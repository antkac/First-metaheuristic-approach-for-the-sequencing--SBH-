# First-metaheuristic-approach-for-the-sequencing--SBH-

Simple Genetic algorithm simulating metaheuristic approach of hybridization sequenicng problem with both positive and negative errors.
This method consists of many steps resulting in the reconstruction of the DNA from oligonucleotides (l-mers).
The chosen approach for selecting the fittest candidates is tournament selection.
